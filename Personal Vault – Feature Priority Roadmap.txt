Image & OCR Support	Extract text from screenshots or photos; AI categorizes and links.
Basic Tagging & Linking	AI suggests tags and links notes to related content.

Outcome: Vault works end-to-end for adding and organizing content. Users can explore and view content in Obsidian.

Phase 2 – Enhanced AI & Media Handling

Goal: Improve organization, handle images and media more intelligently, and start adaptive learning.

Feature	Description
Webpage Image Capture (Optional)	Save images alongside text, optionally tag images separately.
Smart Linking Improvements	AI finds deeper relationships between notes, images, and documents.
Google Drive Integration	Import files from Drive; AI categorizes and links them.
AI Adaptation / Learning	System adjusts categorization, tagging, and linking rules based on user behavior.
