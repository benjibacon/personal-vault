Personal Vault – Master Reference Document for Claude.AI
Purpose

Create a dynamic, AI-driven personal knowledge repository that:

Captures, organizes, and links all types of personal knowledge, hobbies, creative projects, and learning.

Fully Obsidian-compatible (Markdown files, folders, links).

Learns user preferences and evolves over time.

Provides analytics, summaries, and visualizations of stored content.

Quick Add Anywhere makes content capture seamless.

1. Input / Adding Content

Unified Quick Add Anywhere interface:

Home screen widget, shortcut, or share-to function.

Handles all input types with a single AI processing pass.

Content Types & AI Actions:

Input Type	AI Actions
Text Notes (typed or voice-to-text)	Categorize, suggest tags, detect links to existing notes, deduplicate
Clipboard / Shared Text	Categorize, tag, link related notes
Webpages (Chrome Extension)	Capture text; optional images linked; categorize text; tag images optionally; store metadata (URL, title, date)
Images / Screenshots	OCR extracts text; AI categorizes, tags, links to related notes
Files / PDFs / Google Drive Documents	AI reads content, categorizes, tags, links
Structured Notes (Obsidian)	AI suggests folder placement, headings, cross-links
2. AI Processing Layer (Single Pass)

For each new entry, AI simultaneously:

Detects content type and applies any OCR or metadata extraction needed.

Categorizes into main category (Recipes, Coding, Music, Games, Hobbies, Learning, Misc).

Generates tags for search and connections.

Links to related notes automatically.

Detects duplicates or near-duplicates.

Updates internal model to adapt to user preferences for future content.

Benefit: Faster, simpler, consistent, and adaptable processing for all types of content.

3. Storage & Organization

Markdown/Obsidian Structure:

Folder / subfolder system based on categories.

Media Handling:

Images and screenshots stored inside or linked to Markdown note.

Webpage captures store metadata (URL, title, date) alongside text and optional images.

4. Analytics & Summaries (Combined Pipeline)

Trends & Activity: Tracks most active categories, new vs old interests, gaps in learning.

Relationships / Knowledge Graph: Shows connections between topics.

Dynamic Summaries / Clip Shows:

“Best of” collections per category

Timeline of projects, learning, or hobbies

Highlight reels of cross-linked content

Export: Markdown summaries for Obsidian, PDFs, or offline review.

5. Long-Term AI Adaptation

Continuously refines categorization, tagging, and linking based on new data.

Suggests related content or new areas to explore.

Maintains vault organization as it grows indefinitely.

6. Day-in-the-Life Workflow

Morning

Review AI highlights and suggested notes or gaps.

Quick Add: text or voice note → AI categorizes, tags, links.

During the Day

Capture content:

Webpage text + optional images → AI categorizes and links

Clipboard/shared text → AI categorizes and links

Screenshots/images → OCR → categorize & link

Files/PDFs/Google Drive → read, categorize, link

Quick Add Anywhere widget or voice command handles all input.

Evening / Reflection

Explore vault: search, review cross-links, add reflections.

AI shows daily analytics: active categories, new connections, suggested follow-ups.

Weekly / Monthly

AI generates summaries and visualizations: “best of” collections, timelines, highlight reels.

Optional export for Obsidian or offline review.

7. Webpage + Image Capture Details

Text is primary for categorization.

Optional images linked to the same note.

Metadata stored: URL, title, date.

AI optionally tags images if they provide additional context.
