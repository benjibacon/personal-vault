Personal Vault – Claude-Ready Spec (Condensed)

Purpose:
Dynamic, AI-driven personal knowledge repository, Obsidian-compatible, learns and adapts to user behavior, handles text, images, files, webpages, and voice input, and provides analytics and summaries.

1. Input / Quick Add Anywhere

Single entry point for all content: text, clipboard, voice, images/screenshots, links, files, PDFs, Google Drive.

Webpages via Chrome extension: capture text, optional images, store metadata (URL, title, date).

AI detects type, extracts content (OCR for images), categorizes, tags, links, and deduplicates in one pass.

2. AI Processing Layer

Unified, single-pass workflow:

Detect content type, extract text/images.

Categorize (Recipes, Coding, Music, Games, Hobbies, Learning, Misc).

Suggest tags.

Link to related notes.

Deduplicate.

Adapt future categorization based on user behavior.

3. Storage & Organization

Markdown/Obsidian structure, folders per category and subcategory.

Images and screenshots linked inside Markdown notes.

Metadata for webpages and files included in notes.

Folder Example:

Personal Vault/
├── Recipes/ (Desserts, Pasta, Entrees)
├── Coding/ (Python, Web, Scripts)
├── Hobbies/ (Music, Games, Outdoors)
├── Learning/ (Articles, Tutorials, Experiments)
└── Misc/

4. Analytics & Summaries

Combined pipeline: trends, gaps, highlight reels, timelines, visual knowledge graphs.

Exportable to Markdown/PDF.

Highlights cross-linked content, popular categories, and “best of” collections.

5. Long-Term AI Adaptation

Continuous learning: improves categorization, linking, and tagging as the vault grows.

Suggests related notes and new areas to explore.

Background adaptation ensures vault remains organized with minimal manual effort.

6. Typical Workflow

Morning: Review AI highlights and suggested notes; add quick ideas via text/voice.
During Day: Capture webpages, clipboard, files, images, or voice notes; AI handles processing immediately.
Evening: Explore connections, add reflections; AI shows daily trends and connections.
Weekly/Monthly: AI generates dynamic summaries, visualizations, and “clip shows.”

7. Webpage + Image Handling

Text determines primary category.

Images optional; linked to note; AI can assign separate tags.

Metadata stored for reference (URL, title, date).

8. Development Notes / Priorities

Phase 1 (MVP): Quick Add, AI single-pass processing, Markdown storage, text-only webpage capture, basic linking/tagging.

Phase 2: Webpage images, Google Drive integration, AI adaptation/refinement.

Phase 3: Analytics, summaries, knowledge graphs.

Phase 4: Advanced voice input, smart reminders, cross-category insights, interactive visualizations.

Claude can optimize structure, AI logic, or workflow as needed to produce the most effective system.
