Personal Vault – Feature Priority Roadmap

Personal Vault – Claude-Ready Spec (Condensed)

Focus on vault structure, workflows, AI processing, and development priorities. Maintain Obsidian compatibility and ensure AI handles categorization, tagging, linking, deduplication, and adaptation in a single pass. Ensure Quick Add Anywhere functionality for all content types.

Additional Requirements:

Monitor conversation length and content accumulation to trigger backups.

Go slow; work one block of code at a time, confirming it works before moving on.

Keep answers short and precise; avoid repeating points.

Ensure code correctness, no formatting errors.

Create/use sub-agents if helpful, or provide instructions for me to do so.
